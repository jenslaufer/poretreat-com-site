It happened, although you had promised yourself to do it never again:

Instead of working in your home office, you masturbated while watching porn. The search for the hottest scene for your cumshot made time fly by. Now it's hours later; in the office you told me that you needed a little more time for the problem. Feelings of guilt paired with self-pity are gnawing at you. Full of frustration you get the chip package, chocolate and a bottle of beer. Nothing matters anymore anyway.

One way or another, many of my days went by for over 20 years. My life had been dominated by an endless hunger for pornography. In the end, my brain was reprogrammed away from a real healthy sexuality. My only way out seemed to be to end my life. At the last moment I decided to put an end to my previous life.

With many small positive habits and replacing the porn habit with better routines I made it. Today I am porn-free for over a year and living a happier life

With this book I want to show you my way out of porn:

Today is the first day of the rest of your life
